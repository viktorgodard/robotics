- **On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) on Linux, howto**

    - scantool       (very good, easy to use)
    - PiOBDII.py     (good, easy to use)
    - Freediags      (todo)
    - can-utils      (todo)



- **Electronics simulation on Linux, howto**

    - Simulide appimage  (very good, easy to use)
    - Qucs     appimage  (not as good, difficult to use)
    - ngspice  app       (CLI only, the Vim of electronics)
    - gpsim    app       (todo)



- **RISC-V**

    - Freedom-E SDK for HiFive1 board
    - risc-v_hifive1-howto-20181007.bash
    - setup and test history dump



- **Arduino**

    - Getting started labs
    - Processing IDE
    - Arduino howto
    - Sketch scripts for the instrumentation of Tamiya RC Unimog
    - Unamogbot specs notes (yep, I misspelled it, it should be Unimogbot).



- **Old projects**

    - pocketCHIP   (fun but discontinued)
    - Spark Core   (fun but discontinued)
    - Spark Proton (fun but not open hardware)



- **Games**

    - Doom
    - Quake
    - Steam Engine
