Description: Notes regarding the PocketCHIP from NextThingCo

Here are the links for the now defunct company "Next Thing Co" 
They went out of business on May 2018, they were based in Oakland, CA

They started in Kickstarter and their main offering was an open source board
running Linux with GPIO for only $9.00

I got 2 of their Pocket CHIP gaming tablets and a CHIP Pro Dev Kit NTC-100480
with 2 boards around 2016-2017

I believe their demise was the Raspberry Pi Zero W, they just couldn't compete 
on price and specs.

The main dump of all the repos is at the Internet Archive, at:
https://archive.org/details/NextThingCo.GitArchive

They also have stuff in GitHub, although from comments online it seems this one
is missing branches:
