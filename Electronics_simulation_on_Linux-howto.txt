I was playing with some electronic kits that Ruth got me for x-mas.
I started wondering if I can run Electronic circuits simulation on Linux.

I found SimulIDE.

The package exist on the Ubuntu repo, but it is an old version (0.1.7 vs 0.4.15):

sudo apt search simul
simulide/focal 0.1.7+dfsg-2build1 amd64
  simple real time electronic circuit simulator

sudo apt info simulide

Homepage: https://sourceforge.net/projects/simulide
Description: simple real time electronic circuit simulator
 Simulide is a real time electronic circuit simulator intended for hobbist and
 student experimentation with simple general purpose electronic circuits and
 PIC, AVR and Arduino microcontroller simulations.
 PIC and AVR simulation are provided by gpsim and simavr.
End Quote.

The latest version is 0.4.15 at:
https://www.simulide.com/p/home.html
https://www.simulide.com/p/downloads.html

I opted for the AppImage version, since it will mean that it comes with its own dependencies.

mv ~/Downloads/simulide_0.4.15-SR9.AppImage ~/abin/.
cd ~/abin/
chmod 754 simulide_0.4.15-SR9.AppImage

Running the Application:
./simulide_0.4.15-SR9.AppImage

Basic Usage:

The Video tutorials from SimulIDE are at:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv4QSL5PGN15wk41AVjgRdg/videos

The most important thing to notice is on Source components:
  - select "Fixed Voltage" source or any other.
  - to close the circuit select Ground.
  - put whatever else you like in the middle.


Do you want to find about other applications available?
Google: electronic design and simulation  linux

Next, try:

http://qucs.sourceforge.net/install.html#install_ubuntu
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:qucs/qucs
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qucs

NOTE: Qucs will take the color theme from the OS, Dark mode is TERRIBLE on this app so change it to Standard mode.
NOTE: Qucs is not as easy or intuitive as SimulIDE !!!
See video:

Forget the above way to install Qucs, This way via AppImage is better.

and this one that is 100% CLI !!!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngspice

NGSPICE latest version is 35, the one available on the Ubuntu 20.04 repo is 31.
version 31 is from 2019, so it is good enough to try.

sudo apt install ngspice

This is a great introduction video!!!
