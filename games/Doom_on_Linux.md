# Installing DOOM on Ubuntu Linux

I found 2 possibilities:

1- Using the DoomsDay Engine 
   https://www.addictivetips.com/ubuntu-linux-tips/play-classic-doom-linux-doomsday-engine/

2- Using the PRBoom Engine

## 1- Using the DoomsDay Engine:

Note: the article recommends to get it from the Dengine.net website with wget, 
 but I prefer to use the version included on the Ubuntu repos even if it is a bit older 
 (it is safer this way).

1.1- Search for the Engine package: 

     sudo apt search doomsday

1.2- Install the Engine package: 

     sudo apt install doomsday

1.3- Install the Shareware version of the game: 

     sudo apt install doom-wad-shareware

1.4- On the GUI, open the Doomsday Engine via the icon, then look for DOOM Shareware and start it.

1.5- play the game, here are the main keys: **F1 = help, F2 = save, F3 = load, TAB = map, F7 = exit**

1.6- Also try the Freedom phase 1 and 2 versions of the game: At the Doomsday Engine click on Other, then Freedom: Phase1 or Phase2

1.7- Heretic Shareware and Hexen demo are options too, but I have never played those games.

1.8- TODO: Try installing the doomsday-server, so you can create a LAN party 1990s Style ;)

NOTE: Since Option 1 worked, I did not bother to try option 2 (PRBoom). 
Also note that Doom on Steam is not compatible with Linux.

**Enjoy!**
