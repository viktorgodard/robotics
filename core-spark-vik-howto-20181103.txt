0- once you do all the below, return to the Maker Kit to have some fun:
   https://docs.particle.io/tutorials/hardware-projects/maker-kit/

1- Connect the Spark Core to a usb port on computer

2- start console session
    picocom /dev/ttyACM0

3- Get Core id: Type "i"
   Your core id is 50ff71065067545639590687
   Your core id is 50ff69065067545643420387

4- Connect the Core to a wireless AP (2.4GHz): Type w
   SSID: Robin
   Security 0=unsecured, 1=WEP, 2=WPA, 3=WPA2: 3
   Password: passhere
5- verify you are connected (message will let you know):
    If you see a pulsing cyan light, your Spark Core
      has connected to the Cloud and is ready to go!
    If your LED flashes red or you encounter any other problems,
      visit https://www.spark.io/support to debug.

5.5- To erase the stored Wi-Fi networks on your Core:
     hold the MODE button for about ten seconds, until the RGB LED
     blinks blue rapidly. Go back to step 2.

6- Go to https://build.particle.io/build/new

7- Go to the devices icon (the target symbol in the lower left)

8- add your new device:
      add the id: 50ff71065067545639590687
      set a name: vik-core-01
      add the id: 50ff69065067545643420387
      set a name: vik-core-02

9- Run the fist demo code to blin an LED to make sure all is working
   use the web IDE

10- Install the Particle CLI as per 
    # https://docs.particle.io/tutorials/developer-tools/cli/
    bash <( curl -sL https://particle.io/install-cli )
    # make sure /home/viktor/bin is in your shell path
 
11- Get started by running 

    particle --version
    Output: 1.35.2

    particle login
    # you will be asked for login(email) and password.
    
    particle list
    Output: vik-core-01 [50ff71065067545639590687] (Core) is offline

12- now to set up a new device, you can actually do it via the CLI:

    particle serial list
    Output: Found 1 device connected via serial:
            /dev/ttyACM0 - Core

    particle identify
    Output: Your device id is 50ff69065067545643420387
            Unable to determine system firmware version

    
    set device in DFU mode before firmware update:
    https://docs.particle.io/tutorials/device-os/led/core/#dfu-mode-device-firmware-upgrade-
    To enter DFU Mode:
      Hold down BOTH buttons
      Release only the RST button, while holding down the MODE button.
      Wait for the LED to start flashing yellow
      Release the MODE button

     Make sure you have UDEV rules in place to access serial without root:
     sudo cp '/home/viktor/.particle/node_modules/particle-cli/dist/lib/../../assets/50-particle.rules' '/etc/udev/rules.d/'

     Physically unplug and reconnect the Particle device.
     Then run the particle command again.

     now you can flash it:
     particle update

     Output: ! There are currently no system firmware updates available for this device.


13- Factory Reset:
    A factory reset restores the firmware on the Core to the default Tinker app
   and clears all your Wi-Fi credentials.
   Procedure:
The procedure is same as the one described above (DFU Mode), but in this case you should continue holding down the MODE button until you see the Core change from blinking yellow to blinking white. Then release the button. The Core should begin after the factory reset is complete.
- Hold down BOTH buttons
- Release only the RST button, while holding down the MODE button.
- Wait for the LED to start blinking yellow (continue to hold the MODE button)
- The LED will turn solid white (continue to hold the MODE button)
  Finally, the LED will turn blink white rapidly
- Release the MODE button
- You can reset Wi-Fi credentials by performing a Wi-Fi Network Reset.

14- Initial setup via CLI:
